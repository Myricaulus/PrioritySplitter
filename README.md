# PrioritySplitter
Factorio mod: Priority Splitter. It favorizes one belt until its full, then overflows to the second. 
Based on Hacked-Splitter from Docktorstick at https://bitbucket.org/doktorstick/hacked-splitters
Demo video: https://youtu.be/4HEi2TyTpt4

Known issues:
- Deconstructing these splitters destroys the buffer contents
- Since 0.15 the visuals are broken, like these from hacked splitter. Maybe he has fixed that already, i didnt checked that yet.
- some smaller efficiency stuff
- some minor belt compression issues still
- info.json still copy of hacked splitter
